# Zillow

Kaggle competition to predict the error of the Zillow Zestimate. Competition ongoing.

The main interesting thing about this competition is that the data we were given has a lot of NaN entries. The data has to be cleaned up in order to be really useful. I haven't finished cleaning the data yet, but in the ZillowExplore notebook I've started the process.
